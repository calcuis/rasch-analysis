# rasch-analysis
an example of a Python function that performs Rasch analysis

```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def perform_rasch_analysis(data):
    # Create the LinearRegression object
    regressor = LinearRegression()

    # Extract the predictors and outcomes from the data
    X = data[:, :-1]
    y = data[:, -1]

    # Fit the predictors and outcomes to the regressor
    regressor.fit(X, y)

    # Get the coefficients and store them in the results dictionary
    results = {"coefficients": regressor.coef_}

    # Return the results
    return results
```

In this function, we first import the necessary modules. Then, we define the function `perform_rasch_analysis`, which takes in a single argument: the data to be analyzed.

Next, we create a `LinearRegression` object, which we will use to fit the data and calculate the coefficients. We also extract the predictors and outcomes from the data.

Then, we use the `LinearRegression` object to fit the predictors and outcomes, and store the coefficients in a results dictionary.

Finally, we return the results dictionary, which contains the coefficients calculated by the Rasch analysis. These coefficients can be used to interpret the relationships between the variables in the data and understand the underlying structure of the data.
